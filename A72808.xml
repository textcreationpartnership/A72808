            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE HONOVRABLE HOVSE OF Commons aſſembled in Parliament.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble petition of the Master, Wardens, Aſſistants, and Company of Brewers in London, and within foure miles compaſſe of the ſame Citie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N all humble maner, Shewing, that whereas of late yeeres his Maieſties Puruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or hath vſed to come and take from your petitioners (being free-men of the Citie of London) Beere and Ale for his Highneſſe vſe, which antiently of free-men within the ſaid Citie hath not been taken. In reſpect whereof, and for that many of your petitioners were and ſtill are verie poore and needie, and could not liue and maintaine their great charge if they had not readie money for their Ale and beere ſo taken, or at leaſt trew payment for the ſame in ſhort time after. The petitioners to preuent their owne impoueriſhment and vndoing, were forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to denie the Purueyor the taking of their Ale and Beere as aforeſaid, whereupon warrants were granted forth to commit ſuch of your petitioners to priſon as refuſed ſo to doe, vntill they ſhould be contented to yeeld to ſuch takings, or elſe to pay foure pence for euerie quarter of Mault your petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould brew.</p>
            <p>Your petitioners manie of them being in priſon a long time, to their great loſſe and charges, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous of their libertie that they might imploy themſelues in their profeſſion for the maintenance of them, their wiues, children, and great families, were then compelled to procure their enlargement by yeelding to the payment of the ſaid foure pence for euerie quarter of Mault they ſhould brew, which payments your petitioners haue been euer ſince forced to performe.</p>
            <p>Now ſo it is, if it may pleaſe this Honourable Aſſembly, that the ſaid foure pence impoſed on your petitioners, as aforeſaid, being a new taxation, is more grieuous and burthenſome vnto them, then if they payd ten Subſidies a yeere, For that beſides the charge thereof, The vndertaker or farmer of thoſe groats hath formerly vexed and ſued your petitioners in the Court of Requeſt, And the now vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers or farmers doe continually threaten to ſue and exhibit Bills and Interrogatories in the Court aforeſaid, to examine your petitioners and their ſeruants vpon their oathes, vnleſſe your petitioners will condiſcend to what compoſition they pleaſe, not contented with any reaſonable gaine, notwithſtanding they are brethren of one Company, to the great terrour, grieuance, and further impoueriſhing of your petitioners, and the generall hurt and inconuenience of the ſaid Citie, and thoſe within foure miles compaſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Neither doth this new taxation vpon euerie quarter of Mault impoſed on your petitioners free them or any kind of way eaſe them from Subſidies, Taxes, Fifteenes, or any ſuch like payments, nor gaines your petitioners any benefit extraordinarie more then any other Subiects haue who pay no ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>The premiſſes conſidered, May it pleaſe this High Court of Parliament for relieuing of ſo great a number from this heauie burthen of foure pence vpon euerie quarter of Mault, and for preuenting of the like inconuenience that may enſue, to grant them your fauour herein, And ſo they leaue it to your Graue conſiderations.</p>
            <p>And they and their poſteritie ſhall be ouer bound to pray for your Honours long health and proſperitie.</p>
